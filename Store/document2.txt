Explains that machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that aims at solving real life engineering problems. it uses mathematical models, heuristic learning, knowledge acquisitions and decision trees for decision making.
Explains the application of machine learning models on human disease diagnosis aids medical experts based on the symptoms at an early stage.
Explains that supervised learning is the most common form of machine learning scheme used in solving engineering problems.
Explains that unsupervised learning algorithms are mostly focused on finding hidden patterns in data, such as user profile information in a social network. they can also be classified as semi-supervised.
Explains that ml algorithms might have a reinforcement learning approach. reinforcement learning occurs when algorithms learn based on external feedback.
Explains that ml algorithms use mathematical or statistical analysis to learn, draw conclusions or infer data. they have been categorized based on the purpose for which they are designed.
Explains that every machine learning algorithm has a specific technique of learning and is based on the values of their parameters. one has to fine tune the algorithm parameters that best suits the problem.
Explains that the job search engine is simple and intuitive with two inputs: keywords and location. the search results page displays a list of matching jobs, ranked by relevance.
Explains that the decision to go beyond search and add job searching—a new mode of interaction—is based on several key reasons.
Explains that searching jobs is significantly different from searching products or movies. rapid inventory growth, new users, and content freshness are just a few of the things they took into consideration when building their engine.
