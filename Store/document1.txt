It can be thought as the most appropriate way of mapping a 
set of input variables with a set of output variables. 
The system learns to infer a function from a collection of
 labeled training data. The training dataset contains a set of input 
 features and several instance values for respective features. 
 The predictive performance accuracy of a machine learning algorithm 
 depends on the supervised learning scheme [8]. 
 The aim of the inferred function may be to solve a regression or classification problem. 
 There are several metrics used in the measurement of the learning task like accuracy, 
 sensitivity, specificity, kappa value, area under the curve etc. 
 In this work, the aim is to classify the patients as healthy or ill based on the 
 past medical records. Before solving any engineering problem, 
 it is vital that it is necessary to choose a suitable algorithm for
  the training purpose based on the type of the data. 
  The selection of a method depends primarily on the type of the data as the field
   of machine learning is data driven.
