Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that 
aims at solving real life engineering problems. 
It provides the opportunity to learn without being explicitly 
programmed and it is based on the concept of learning from data. 
It is so much ubiquitously used dozen a times a day that we may not even know it. 
The advantage of machine learning (ML) methods  is that it uses mathematical models, 
heuristic learning, knowledge acquisitions and decision trees for decision making. 
Thus, it provides controllability, observability and stability. 
It updates easily by adding a new patientâ€˜s record.
